# Onfido SDK Sample App

## Overview

The purpose of this app is to show how to use the Onfido JavaScript SDK by use of the npm module. By use of script tags you can see the example in the [SDK repo here](https://github.com/onfido/onfido-sdk-ui).

## Run the app

Create a file `./secrets.json` and add an `apiToken` to it as a JSON property.

Example:

```json
{
  "apiToken":"something_1321321321j3123kkljkkl"
}

```

Git clone the project and run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`.
